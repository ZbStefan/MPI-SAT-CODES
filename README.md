To run any of the SAT solvers in this repository, make sure you have Python 3 installed, then open a terminal and use the command python resolution_solver.py file_name, replacing file_name with the path to your CNF file in DIMACS format. The same applies for the other solvers, dp_solver.py, gsat_solver.py and dpll_solver.py, which can be run as python dp_solver.py file_name or python dpll_solver.py file_name or python gsat_solver.py file_name. Each script expects a valid .cnf file(which are already in this repository) and will output whether the formula is satisfiable the number of steps, along with the time and memory used during execution. No external libraries are required, only standard Python libraries such as sys, time, tracemalloc, random, and collections are used.
